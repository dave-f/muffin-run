# Arty's muffin run
My first Pico 8 game, this is just a very simple side-scrolling title.

The king's collection of sky-based muffins has long been his pride and joy, and recently our hero has gotten a taste for them!

This has caught the king somewhat on the back foot, and his royal guards so far have only managed to manufacture weapons to fire moustaches. You must help Arty get his fill of lovely muffins in as short a time as possible, before the king's guards invent something with a little more firepower!
